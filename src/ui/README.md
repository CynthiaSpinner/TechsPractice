# ui

This directory contains UI components, layouts, and design-related components that make up the visual parts of the application. These components are reusable UI elements that can be assembled to create the user interface of the app.

## Purpose
The `ui` directory houses all reusable UI components like buttons, modals, form elements, and other UI patterns that are used across the app. The goal is to have a consistent look and feel with components that can be reused and customized.

## Example Usage
- **Buttons**: A reusable `Button` component with customizable styles and actions.
- **Forms**: Reusable form components like `Input`, `Select`, `Textarea`.
- **Layouts**: Container components that control the layout structure (e.g., `Grid`, `Flex`).

## Structure
- **Components**: Reusable UI components that are part of the UI.
- **Layouts**: Layout components that handle the overall structure of the page.
- **Atoms & Molecules**: Small UI elements (e.g., `Button`) and more complex structures (e.g., `Card`, `Modal`).

## Example
```typescript
// Example: Button.tsx in ui

interface ButtonProps {
  text: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  className?: string;
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ text, onClick, className }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick} className={`btn ${className}`}>
    {text}
  </button>
);

export default Button;
