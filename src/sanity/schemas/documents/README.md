# Documents

This directory contains the core content types for your Sanity CMS. Documents represent actual entries or content pieces that will be created, stored, and managed within the CMS. These are the building blocks of your content model and correspond to pages, articles, or other content that your users will interact with.

## Purpose
Documents represent content that you want to publish or manage within your CMS. These are typically things like pages (e.g., Home, About), blog posts, product listings, or any other entity that has its own standalone data.

## Example Usage
For example:
- `navigation.ts`: Manages the links used in your website’s header or navigation.
- `post.ts`: A document type for blog posts, articles, or news content.

## Structure
- **Types of content**: Documents like blog posts, pages, or any content that has standalone data.
- **Fields**: Document fields define the structure of each content type (e.g., title, body, images, etc.).

## Note
Use this directory for types that represent content entries—individual pieces of content that will be created and published within the CMS.
