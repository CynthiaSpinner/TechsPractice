# Custom Types

This directory contains custom, reusable types that are designed to be used across multiple documents or modules in the Sanity CMS.

## Purpose
Custom types are used for more abstract or complex data structures that can be referenced in other documents or content types. These might not be content themselves but can be used as fields or templates in your main content.

## Example Usage
For example, if you have a custom type like `richText`, you might use it in multiple documents like articles, blogs, or even in navigation fields.

## Structure
- **Fields**: Custom field types or specialized data structures.
- **Reusable data**: Objects or components that might be used across multiple content types.

## Note
Use this directory for defining types that are meant to be used across various documents or need to be referenced by other schemas, but are not content themselves.
