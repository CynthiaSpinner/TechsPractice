import axios from "axios";

# lib

This directory contains utility functions, classes, or modules that provide reusable functionality across the application. These are typically helper functions or custom logic that can be imported and used anywhere in your app.

## Purpose
The `lib` directory is used to store all generic utility code that doesn't belong to any specific component or page. These utilities can be anything from API interaction logic, custom hooks, formatters, or other helper functions that improve code reusability.

## Example Usage
- **API client**: A function that centralizes all API calls (e.g., Axios or Fetch).
- **Helper functions**: Reusable logic for data transformations or manipulations.
- **Custom hooks**: Reusable React hooks for managing specific behaviors (e.g., `useLocalStorage` or `useFetch`).

## Structure
- **Modules**: Functions, classes, or hooks that offer utility and reusable functionality.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module or file should have a single responsibility to make it easier to understand, maintain, and test.

## Example
```typescript
// Example: apiClient.ts in lib

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: '/api',
});

export const fetchData = async (endpoint: string) => {
  try {
    const response = await apiClient.get(endpoint);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
